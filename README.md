## Description 
EP Coding is an Apple iOS app that is intended to help practicing cardiac electrophysiology (EP) doctors document and bill their procedures by selecting proper CPT® codes, based on the latest coding guidelines.  The app is not for professional coders, and does not take into account the coding modifiers and different coding specifications of various billing agencies.  It is useful for those physicians who need to enter procedure codes directly into EHR systems, such as EPIC, or who just need to communicate to the coders what they have done.  Of course all codes billed must also be documented in procedure notes.  The rules for entering codes are complex, and the codes themselves are not mnemonic, hence this app.  This app currently uses the 2014 codes, but will be updated as coding changes.  We are not liable for any errors in coding that might occur from using this app, please see the licensing information below.

The ultimate source is the CPT® 2013 and 2014 Professional Editions, available
from the
[American Medical Association](http://http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/cpt/cpt-featured-products.page?).
The AMA stipulates a license fee for use of their codes.  The CPT®
codes used in this program are only a small subset of the thousands of
codes available, and full descriptions of the codes are not included.
The data for this program was drawn from other readily available free
sources, including the
[Boston Scientific 2013 Billing and Coding Guide](http://http://www.bostonscientific.com/cardiac-rhythm-resources/assets/downloads/reimbursement/2013/CRM-129704-AA-2013-Billing-CodingGuide.pdf),
and articles such as
[this one](http://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Changes-Coming-2013-CPT-Codes).
For these reasons, it is felt that the use of the small subset of
codes applicable to EP is covered under the
[Fair Use Doctrine](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) of
the Copyright Act and not subjected to the licensing fees imposed by
the AMA.  A full discussion of the rationale for fair use of these
codes is contained on [our website](http://www.epstudiossoftware.com/?p=1313).
