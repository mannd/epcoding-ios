* EP Coding Help
** Who should use EP Coding?
   Physicians who perform cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures
   and are required to submit CPT® codes for these procedures. *EP
   Coding* is intended to help EP physicians enter the correct codes
   in an EHR (Electronic Health Record).  It is not intended for
   professional coders nor is it a substitute for the
   [[https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store/][AMA official CPT® documentation]].
** How does EP Coding help?
   - Lists relevant CPT® codes for EP procedures, with succinct descriptions.
   - Makes clear which codes cannot be combined for specific procedures.
   - Analyzes selected codes for errors and warnings.
   - Provides [[General hints][help on how to code procedures]].
** How to use EP Coding
   - Select a procedure from the list by tapping on it.
   - Codes are organized as primary codes, at least one of which
     needs to be selected, and additional or optional codes which
     are commonly used with the primary procedure codes.
   - Codes are organized logically, not necessarily in numeric
     order, with description given first, followed by code number.
   - Select codes by tapping them.
   - Codes that must be selected for a particular procedure are green
     and already selected.  Codes that cannot be selected are crosshatched in gray..
     Codes you select are yellow.
   - Long press on a code to bring up a list of common code /modifiers/
     that can be added or removed from each code.  Further information
     on using modifiers is presented [[Modifiers][below]].
   - Tap *Sedation* at the bottom of the screen to add sedation codes.
     Sedation coding is unbundled from procedure codes as of 2017 and
     must be calculated based on sedation time and other factors.  *EP
     Coding* includes a handy sedation calculator described further
     [[Sedation][below]].
   - Tap *Summarize* to show a summary of the codes selected along
     with any comments, warnings or errors (highlighted in green,
     orange or red respectively.
   - Tap *Clear* to clear the selected codes.
   - Tap *Save* to save your selection of additional codes as a
     default.  If you nearly always select the same additional codes
     (e.g. always do 3D mapping with SVT ablation), save the codes and
     they will pre-selected when you use the app again. Note that
     primary code selections are not saved.
   - Tap the menu icon on the upper right of the screen for more options.
     - Tap *Search* to search for codes by name or number.  Note that
       due to the [[Abbreviations][abbreviations]] used, a search that you expect to have
       results may come up empty.  For example to search for
       pacer/pacemaker codes, search for "PPM."
     - Tap *Device Wizard* to steer you through complex device
       upgrades and revisions.
   - The all EP codes module lists every EP procedure code in
     numerical order, with code number given first.  It is the /a la
     carte/ menu of *EP Coding*.
** Limitations
   - EP procedure codes only.
   - No surgical EP codes (e.g. LV lead via thoracotomy).
   - Some rare or obsolete codes are not included.
   - Code descriptions are paraphrased.
   - Code components are not given or are incomplete.
   - No office based or in-patient billing codes.
   - No device programming codes.
   - Only limited, common code modifiers are presented.
** General hints
   - Use the specific procedure modules rather than the all EP codes
     module for coding procedures.
   - You may find it easier to use the *Device Wizard* to do device
     upgrade coding rather than use the Upgrade/Revise/Extract module.
   - Use the all EP codes module if you need to look up a specific
     code, as they are listed in numeric order in this module.
   - There are some rarely used codes in the all EP codes module that
     aren't present in the other modules.
   - Don't try to add codes that are disabled in a procedure module.
   - If you nearly always add codes to a procedure (e.g. 3D mapping
     with AFB ablation), then save it as a default using the Save
     icon.
   - *Warnings* (orange) point out codes that you may be
     missing or code combinations that possibly shouldn't be used together.
   - *Errors* (red) indicate code combinations that almost certainly
     are not allowed.
   - Check with your coders or the [[https://commerce.ama-assn.org/store/][AMA documentation]] if you are not
     sure how to code a procedure.

** AFB ablation
   - Includes comprehensive EP testing, LA pacing and recording and
     transseptal puncture.
   - Add 93657 if additional AFB ablation done beyond pulmonary vein
     isolation.
   - Add 93655 if separate supraventricular arrhythmia mechanism
     ablated (e.g. focal atrial tachycardia).
** SVT ablation
   - Includes comprehensive EP testing.
   - SVT ablation code is used for any kind of SVT ablation including
     WPW, focal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, and AV nodal
     reentry.
** VT ablation
   - Includes comprehensive EP testing, LV pacing and recording, and
     mapping codes.
   - You can't add mapping codes 93609 or 93613 to VT ablation!
** AV node ablation
   - It is not clear if EP testing codes can be combined with AV
     node ablation.
   - It is not clear if mapping codes can be combined with AV node ablation.
   - These points may need to be clarified with your coders.
** EP testing
   - Use 93620 (EP testing with attempted arrhythmia
     induction).
   - Don't code with ablation procedures (? exception AV node
     ablation).
   - You can add mapping codes, but don't add ablation codes to EP
     testing.
** New PPM or ICD
   - Use 33206 to 33208 for new PPM depending on number of leads.
   - Use 33249 for new single or dual ICD.
   - Add code 33225 to dual chamber device code for PPM or ICD with CRT.
   - Add 93641 if you do DFT testing during the ICD implant.
   - Placing a sub-cutaneous array is probably best coded with 33999
     (unlisted surgical procedure code).
** Replace PPM or ICD
   - Use 33227 to 33229 for PPM replacement and 33262 to 33264 for ICD
     replacement depending on number of leads.
   - Do not add generator removal codes to these codes!
   - Add 93641 if you do DFT testing during ICD generator replacement.
** SubQ ICD/Leadless PPM
   - SubQ ICD has new codes in 2015.
   - Leadless PPM codes are new and are emerging technology codes that are temporary and will probably be changed in the next revision of the codes.
** Upgrade/revise/extract
   - This is the most complicated coding area. We will break this
     down into some specific situations.  You can also use
     the *Device Wizard* to lead you through this.  This is the
     simplest way to do this!
   - Note codes are arranged in logical groups, not necessarily in
     numeric order.
*** Lead addition only, no change in generator
    - Use specific lead placement code, e.g. 33216, place A lead.
    - Use 33224 to place an LV lead if the CRT generator is already there.
*** Lead repositioning
    - Reposition previously implanted single A or V lead: 33215
    - Reposition previously implanted LV lead: 33226
*** Removal of generator alone
    - PPM generator removal: 33233
    - ICD generator removal: 33241
    - Don't use these codes in conjunction with generator-only
      replacement codes, but do use them with new/replacement system
      codes for upgrades (see [[Upgrade of system]]).
*** Removal/extraction of leads
    - PPM single lead extraction: 33234
    - PPM dual lead extraction: 33235
    - ICD 1 or 2 leads extracted: 33244
    - LV lead extraction has no specific code, probably should use
      33234 or 33999 (unlisted procedure).
*** Removal of entire system without replacement
    - Use combination of generator removal and lead removal codes as
      appropriate.
*** New/replacement device
    - PPM: 33206 to 33208
    - ICD: 33249
    - Plus LV lead: 33225
*** Upgrade of system
    - Single chamber to dual chamber PPM (includes new lead, removal
      of old generator and placement of new generator) : 33214
    - Other situations: code removal of generator and removal of
      leads if leads are removed, then code for insertion of new system.
    - Example: upgrade of single chamber PPM to ICD with CRT.
      - Code PPM generator removal: 33233
      - Code single or dual ICD system implant: 33249
      - Code implant LV lead with new system: 33225
*** Place generator, existing leads
    - Single chamber PPM generator: 33212
    - Dual chamber PPM generator: 33213
    - Single chamber ICD generator: 33240
    - Dual chamber ICD generator: 33230
    - CRT ICD generator: 33231
*** Pocket revision
    - PPM pocket revision: 33222
    - ICD pocket revision: 33223
*** Lead repair
    - One lead repaired: 33218
    - Two leads repaired: 33220
** Other procedures
   - These are miscellaneous EP procedures.
   - Fluoroscopy to check for lead integrity: 76000
** All EP codes
   - Lists all codes in the app in /numeric/ order.
   - Avoid using this module unless other ones don't cover coding
     because procedure is unusual or rarely done.
   - Code analysis may not check every combination of codes selected
     in this module.
   - This module can be useful to look up specific code numbers.
   - Sedation codes are listed, but the sedation calculator is not available in this module.
